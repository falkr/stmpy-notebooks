    "By declaring these messages, we have decoupled the threads in the system. The user interface has its own thread, otherwise you could not scroll and use buttons while your program is busy. To synchronize the user interface with other processes, like the controller of our blinking light, we use messages. The benefit with these messages is that they don't block the caller, as a function would do. The caller just sends the message and continues, without being blocked. This \"untangles\" our concurrency problem, and we can solve it explicitly with states and transitions in the state machine. Here, we are much more flexible, which pays off once we have something slighlty more complex than the signal light.\n",
