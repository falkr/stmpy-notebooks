    "# Polling With Two State Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "One team asked how they should incorporate a sensor into their design. Some sensors have an interface that requires you to check periodically if the sensor value changed in a specific way that is interesting to you. For instance, a passive infrared sensor (PIR) may require that you poll regularly if it detected a motion. Or you want to check if a tmperature sensor has detected a change in temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we check  a sensor periodically, we also call that **polling**. In a state machine, this is easy to implement with a transition that is periodocally triggered by a timer. Of course, you can integrate polling into the state machine for your main logic. But this can make the main state machine quite complex. Instead, you can also do the polling in a separate state machine, and only send a signal to another state machine if you detected a significant change. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is walking through an example step by step. You can execute each cell that contains Python code cell by cell. Just select the cell, then press Shift + Enter. This executes the cell and moves to the next one.\n",
