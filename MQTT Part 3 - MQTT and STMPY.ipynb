    "# Combining MQTT and STMPY\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we want to combine MQTT with a STMPY state machine. For just getting this first connection implemented, the result does nothing really useful, but should be easy to run and debug. I promise, the system we are going to build next week based on what we learn this week will be more useful, but this way we can learn one thing at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    " * We subscribe to an MQTT topic.\n",
    " * Whenever we receive a message at that topic, we trigger an event `message` in the state machine.\n",
    " * The state machine just switches between to states `tick` and `tock`.\n",
    " * Whenver the state machine switches, it also publishes an MQTT message that show the number of ticks and tocks.\n",
    " \n",
    "Here is the diagram of the machine:\n",
