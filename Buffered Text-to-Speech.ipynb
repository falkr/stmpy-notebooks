    "- Speaking the text takes time, depending on how long the text is that the computer should speak.\n",
    "- Commands for speaking can arrive at any time, and we would like our state machine to process one of them at a time. So, even if we send three messages to it shortly after each other, it processes them one after the other.\n",
